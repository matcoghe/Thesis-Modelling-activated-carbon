# Thesis Modelling activated carbon adsorption kinetics for removal of micropollutants from wastewater

### Mathieu Coghe
- PSDM = comprehensive mass-transfer model "Pore Surface Diffusion Model", strong candidate for modelling adsorption of OMPs onto GAC
- Code is from GitHub USEPA: https://github.com/USEPA/Water_Treatment_Models.git (see references)
- Folders according to thesis paragraphs 
- I executed PSDM through the notebook (.ipynb). This notebook uses the scripts PSMD.py, PSDM_extra.py, PSDM_functions.py and PSDM_tools.py. Edits or extensions are highlighted with //Mathieu (Ctrl+F)
- Input data from Input_Compound.xlsx or example from EPA which is Example_TCE.xlsx
